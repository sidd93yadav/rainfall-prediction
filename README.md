# rainfall-prediction
This project aimed to predict rainfall levels (PrecipitationSumInches) using weather data from the Austin Weather dataset. The data included temperature, humidity, dew point, wind speed, visibility, and pressure values. After removing irrelevant columns and cleaning the data (handling trace amounts "T" and missing symbols "-"), we converted all values to numeric and filled missing data using mean imputation. Exploratory analysis revealed correlations between precipitation and variables like humidity, temperature, and wind speed. We trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn, achieving a reasonable prediction performance, evaluated using RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Visualizations such as scatter plots and correlation heatmaps provided insights into how weather factors influence rainfall. The model and analysis can help in understanding local precipitation patterns and serve as a base for more advanced forecasting techniques.
